1.Slicing the Dataframe
2.Changing the Index
3.Data Conversion
4.Joining and merging
5.Concatenation
6.Changing the column Headers


1.slicing, for slice the particular data in dataframe
 there are 2 type of slice there are head and tail,both need argument which how many data you need to slice
 head -> slice data from the first of dataframe
 tail -> slice data from the end of dataframe

2.Merging -> merge 2 dataframe to become 1 dataframe
 need 2 argument, if you want to merge the first DF and the second DF
 if need 1 particular column then use 3 argument

3.joining -> join 2 dataframe similar with sql

4.changing the index and colum headers

5.concatenation

6.data munging--> change particular format to another format

7.Use Case example

8.Pyhton for statistic
 mean , median (high median , low media) , mode, variance
